--------------------
1. I hope we can integrate a minimum order feature for each product.
2. Whenever I re-publish a recently unpublished product, for example from page 3 of the list of products, the list returns to the very first page. Kind of tedious if you are republishing multiple products located at different pages of the list.	
3. Here's a scenario: Product cost: 80 pesos. If you apply the bank deposit charge and service charges, it may lead to a negative sale. Any comments?
